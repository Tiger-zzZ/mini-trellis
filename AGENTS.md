# mini-trellis

This project uses mini-trellis as a memory layer. Working knowledge lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/spec/` — durable contracts (short markdown; read `index.md` first)
- `.trellis/research/` — topic inbox (`<topic>.md`; `README.md` is not a topic)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals

Record a session with `/trellis:remember` (Claude/OpenCode), `/trellis-remember` (Pi), or `$trellis-remember` (Codex). Search past dialogue with `trellis mem`. Promote lasting boundaries into spec with `trellis-update-spec`.

mini-trellis does not create or drive tasks.

Managed by mini-trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **Trellis** (14336 symbols, 20870 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
